# DBT Assignment

WE're going to extend the DBT Marts and add additional analytic structures to the pipeline. Below is a single example followed by 4 exercises.

1. Assignment 1: Create a "Customer Lifetime Value" Mart
Objective: Create a mart that calculates the lifetime value of each customer based on their total spend in the system.

Instructions:

Create a new model called customer_lifetime_value.sql under the models/marts/sales_reporting/ folder.
In this model, you will calculate the total revenue per customer.
Use the staging table stg_sales to sum up the total_price for each customer (customer_id).
The final mart should include the following columns:
customer_id
total_orders: the total number of orders placed by the customer.
total_revenue: the total amount spent by the customer.
avg_order_value: the average value of a customer's order (total_revenue / total_orders).
SQL Example:

```sql
Copy code
WITH customer_revenue AS (
    SELECT
        customer_id,
        COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders,
        SUM(total_price) AS total_revenue,
        AVG(total_price) AS avg_order_value
    FROM {{ ref('stg_sales') }}
    GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT
    customer_id,
    total_orders,
    total_revenue,
    avg_order_value
FROM customer_revenue
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

2. Assignment 2: Create a "Product Category Performance" Mart
Objective: Create a mart that aggregates product sales by product category.

Instructions:

Create a new model called category_performance.sql under the models/marts/sales_reporting/ folder.
Use the stg_products and stg_sales tables to create this mart.
Join stg_sales with stg_products to group products by their category.
Calculate the following fields:
category: the product category.
total_sales: the total number of units sold per category.
total_revenue: the total revenue generated per category.
avg_price: the average price of products sold in that category.


3. Assignment 3: Create a "Monthly Revenue and Orders" Mart
Objective: Create a mart that aggregates monthly revenue and the number of orders placed.

Instructions:

Create a new model called monthly_revenue_orders.sql under the models/marts/sales_reporting/ folder.
Use the stg_sales table to calculate revenue and order counts by month.
Extract the month from the order_date and group by it.
The mart should have the following columns:
month: the month of the year (e.g., '2024-09').
total_orders: the total number of orders placed in that month.
total_revenue: the total revenue generated in that month.


4. Assignment 4: Create a "Customer Order Frequency" Mart
Objective: Create a mart that calculates how frequently each customer places an order.

Instructions:

Create a new model called customer_order_frequency.sql under the models/marts/sales_reporting/ folder.
Use the stg_sales table to calculate the average number of days between a customer's orders.
The mart should include:
customer_id
total_orders: the total number of orders placed.
first_order: the date of the first order.
last_order: the date of the last order.
avg_days_between_orders: the average time (in days) between each order for that customer.


5. Assignment 5: Create a "Top 10 Customers by Revenue" Mart
Objective: Create a mart that lists the top 10 customers by total revenue generated.

Instructions:

Create a new model called top_10_customers_by_revenue.sql under the models/marts/sales_reporting/ folder.
Use the stg_sales table to calculate the total revenue generated by each customer.
Rank the customers by their total revenue and limit the result to the top 10.
The mart should include:
customer_id
total_orders: the total number of orders placed by the customer.
total_revenue: the total revenue generated by the customer.
